# Play-that-music-CET
music playing using opencv gestures
According to the upward and downward movement of a blue object, the computer will make a sound.
Tried two different methods.
One ,I made a code where it detects the centroid of a blue/orange color and plays music according to the movement of the color.
second,I used a code for pose estimation and trying to use human pose estimation,sort of like using gestures for playing music.
